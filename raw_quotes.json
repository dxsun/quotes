'Well kind of. Doing 365 quotes was a really forceful way to tell myself that we can't find any meaning just by sitting around and typing up some useless quotes.' 'But wouldn't you need the knowledge of quotes in order to guide our actions?' 'Well you're right. There's no application without any theory behind it. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there always needs to be some balance in life, which is a recurring theme in my quotes. The balance here is between personal thought and action. Doing 365 quotes taught me how strong my intentions and thoughts were, but how empty my actions had been. Doing these quotes also showed me the power of self-thought. I impressed myself way too many times with the surprisingly deep quotes I was creating, and I think it is in anybody's power to create their own philosophy in life.' 'Sounds deep... So then what is the meaning of my life?'"]
